        <h1>Refund Policy</h1>
        <p>Last updated: February 10, 2026</p>

        <h2>1. Satisfaction Guarantee</h2>
        <p>We want you to be completely satisfied with our products. If you are not satisfied with your purchase, you
            may request a refund under the conditions outlined below.</p>

        <h2>2. Eligibility for Refunds</h2>
        <p>Refunds are generally available for purchases made within the last <strong>14 days</strong> if:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The software does not function as described.</li>
            <li>You feature-breaking bugs that we are unable to fix in a reasonable timeframe.</li>
            <li>You purchased the wrong license by mistake.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3. Non-Refundable Circumstances</h2>
        <p>We may decline refund requests if:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The request is made more than 14 days after purchase.</li>
            <li>The software was used for unauthorized or illegal purposes.</li>
            <li>The issue is caused by third-party platform changes (e.g., if Telegram blocks the method entirely),
                though we will make every effort to restore functionality first.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>4. How to Request a Refund</h2>
        <p>To request a refund, please contact our support team at <a
                href="mailto:support@codeaeternum.com">support@codeaeternum.com</a> with your Order ID and the reason
            for the refund request.</p>

        <h2>5. Processing Time</h2>
        <p>Refunds are processed by our payment provider, Paddle.com. Once approved, funds usually return to your
            original payment method within 5-10 business days.</p>
